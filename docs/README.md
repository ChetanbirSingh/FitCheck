## Project Description

### Scope and Functionality

FitCheck is a web application designed to provide AI-powered code reviews for GitHub repositories. Users select a reviewer persona (e.g., Mentor, Recruiter, Senior Developer) and get real-time, markdown-formatted feedback tailored to that perspective. The application supports multiple frontend frameworks and allows users to select specific files for review.

### Motivation

The motivation behind FitCheck was to help developers ‚Äî especially students and job seekers ‚Äî receive clear, relevant, and contextual feedback on their code. It aims to simulate real-world code reviews in a fast, automated way.

## üêû Known Bugs

### üîß Functional Bugs

#### üîÅ Duplicate URL Submission Doesn‚Äôt Trigger Review
If a user submits the same GitHub repo twice in a row, the app doesn't trigger a re-review ‚Äî likely due to unchanged state not re-firing the request.  
**Temporary Fix:** Refresh the page or slightly change the URL (e.g., add/remove a trailing space).  
**Planned:** Force state reset or manual re-fetch logic.

#### üîÑ Persona & Techstack Can Be Changed Mid-Review
Users can change the selected mode or stack after clicking submit, which may cause review mismatches.  
**Planned:** Disable selection buttons as soon as the review starts and re-enable only after it's done.
