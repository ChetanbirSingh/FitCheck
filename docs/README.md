## Project Description

### Scope and Functionality

FitCheck is a web application designed to provide AI-powered code reviews for GitHub repositories. Users select a reviewer persona (e.g., Mentor, Recruiter, Senior Developer) and get real-time, markdown-formatted feedback tailored to that perspective. The application supports multiple frontend frameworks and allows users to select specific files for review.

### Motivation

The motivation behind FitCheck was to help developers — especially students and job seekers — receive clear, relevant, and contextual feedback on their code. It aims to simulate real-world code reviews in a fast, automated way.
